<p>Are you interested in getting high authority backlinks to your website and published in local media 100% free of charge? No PR required! This is going to take a little time and hustle to make happen but well worth your efforts.</p>
<p>3 Easy Steps to get SEO Backlinks:</p>
<p>Step #1 &#8211; Create a list of contacts<br />
Step #2 &#8211; Create a &#8220;Story&#8221; worthy of the news<br />
Step #3 &#8211; Reach out to your contacts with your story</p>
<p>It&#8217;s literally that easy! When submitting my story to the media I always included 3-5 high quality photographs of myself and team, dressed in my bowtie and plaid shirt in my storefront.</p>
<p>Often the publications would use my images because it&#8217;s easier and cheaper than sending a photographer in to take photographs. My emails to writers, editors, producers was always personal (no copy paste BS, and no mass email) and mentioned the persons name, and previous articles that they might have written on the topic. I would always include &#8220;I really enjoyed reading your last article on&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This works! Hustle your way to the top and let me know how it works out for you. Every time you get published with my method from this day forth simply send look in the mirror and say &#8220;Chris was right&#8221; three times.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto"><strong>best SEO company in Toronto</strong></a> please send me an email to nerd@anerdsworld.com today.</p>
<p>I wish you well on your journey to success,</p>

<p>For the continued safety and well-being of our nerds and customers, our head office and flagship store will remain temporarily closed.</p>
<p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Fully Remote Workforce</b></p>
<p>Our whole team is now required to work from home, and we&#8217;re using our internal communications tools such as Zoom, Slack, phone and email, to keep staff updated on the latest COVID-19 developments. We have a strong remote work culture — with over 30 specialists working full time remotely in Toronto — and that has helped us to quickly adapt. This has allowed us to continue to deliver undisrupted work and to support our customers and to remain fully focused on their important projects.</p>
<p>We know that everybody’s circumstances are different, and if you have suggestions for how we can better support you, please let us know by emailing <a class="c-link" href="mailto:nerd@anerdsworld.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-describedby="slack-kit-tooltip">nerd@anerdsworld.com</a>. Chris and I will read every email that we get. We promise to listen to your concerns, consider and discuss your feedback, and continually look for ways for all of us to navigate through this situation with empathy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TwUEFtKflg&#038;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TwUEFtKflg&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>Yes I wear a black t-shirt to work, 6 out of 7 days. Don’t worry, it’s not the same one, I have many black t-shirts. Some are v-necks, other crew cut. I like to believe that they help me look a bit slimmer, in addition to reducing the stresses of my everyday life. Each and every day, I’m faced with making many critical decisions. These decisions are much more important than what I had for breakfast or deciding on what combination of clothes will create my outfit for the day. This got me thinking and I started doing some research to see if there is some sort of phenomenon or something out there, with like-minded individuals. It turns out that my hunch was right, many successful people like entrepreneurs, celebrities and artists wear the same thing every day! The reasoning behind this ranges from making life simpler to just being smart with money. Where it gets more interesting is that there are also proven scientific reasons behind this.</p>
<p>Science is showing us that this concept of simplifying the wardrobe is all related to the concept of decision fatigue. This is a psychological condition where a person’s productivity declines as a result of being mentally exhausted from making so many small, irrelevant decisions throughout everyday life. To make a long story short, it is easy to become less efficient at your work if you’re constantly stressing over things like what to eat or wear every day. Decision fatigue is exactly why individuals like Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Cuban, Steve Jobs, Casey Neistat and Gary Vaynerchuk decided to make life easier. I’d like to share a few details about each of these gentlemen with you, below:</p>
<p><b>Mark Zuckerberg – </b>Net worth of $53.5 Billion USD</p>
<p>Having the second-highest net worth of our 5 people here, this billionaire typically likes to wear a t-shirt or hoodie, along with a pair of jeans. In a Question and Answer session in November 2014, Mark Zuckerberg explains why he wears the same t-shirt everyday:</p>
<p>“I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community.</p>
<p>“I’m in this really lucky position, where I get to wake up every day and help serve more than a billion people. And I feel like I’m not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous about my life.”</p>
<p><b>Mark Cuban – </b>Net worth of $3.2 Billion USD</p>
<p>Similarly to Zuckerberg, Mark Cuban is typically seen wearing the same suit over and over. Decision fatigue is real and Mark Cuban has been seen advocating to young millennials to live cheap and that clothes and cars don’t really matter.</p>
<p><b>Steve Jobs – </b>Net worth of $29.2 Billion USD</p>
<p>Steve Jobs is known for his signature black turtle neck and jeans. He was such a fan of this simple, repeatable look, that at one point he tried to have the whole company wear the same uniform. Jobs took a trip to Japan in the 1980s and was very moved to see everyone at Sony wearing a uniform. He took to the idea of adopting something similar at Apple. He thought that wearing the same corporate attire would help Apple employees come together&#8211;something school uniforms never seem to quite manage. He ultimately got booed for this.</p>
<p><b>Casey Neistat – </b>Net worth of $1.5 Million USD</p>
<p>While Casey Neistat will wear a suit when he has to, his daily threads consist of jeans or joggers, a t-shirt and/or crewneck sweater, a pair of high-tops, some wrist-wear that is often a balance of a high-end watch/apple watch and a few random beads and bracelets and – in the cooler months – a few layers of black jacketing. Casey Neistat both embraces and defies the negative – nerdy connotations that come with wearing a fanny pack or cell-phone belt clip, and keeps a digital camera holstered on his belt at all times. This may make you think that Neistat isn’t a fan of order and organization. You’d be wrong to assume that. Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb60rrtTddQ" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">studio video</span></a> to see what this man’s organizational capabilities are made of.</p>
<p><b>Gary Vaynerchuk – </b>Estimated Net worth of $100 Million USD</p>
<p>I’d like to share one of Gary’s famous quotes:</p>
<p>“<i>You know I’m an Entrepreneur really, Like really really really what I am, I mean at 4 years old if you’re ripping flowers out of people’s yards and ringing their doorbell and desperately asking them to buy it or when your six and everyone wants to play dodge ball, or go on the swings and your desperately trying to get everybody to stand behind a lemonade stand for 8 hours during their summer vacation, I’m an Entrepreneur, I’m a salesman”</i></p>
<p>He’s a very inspirational character that has experience in the world of Wine, Novel-writing and business investments. Like the other gentlemen of today’s article, Gary is routinely seen wearing the same casual outfit, further showing us proof that decision fatigue is a real thing.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re coming to A Nerd’s World for a meeting, don&#8217;t be surprised if you see us dressed in t-shirts and Nikes. Let us impress you with our expertise and skills, rather than superficial appearances.</p>
<p>We’re here for hire. Give us a call today at <b>(647) 348 2020</b> to talk about your digital media needs!</p>

<p>If we go back to 5 or 6 years ago, you&#8217;d have to rent a helicopter, get permits and spend a lot of money to be able to go into the sky and get this kind of footage. You can do it today with us at a fraction of that cost and with 1 hour of notice! Using the latest <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/review-dji-phantom-4/" target="_blank"><strong>DJI Phantom 4</strong></a>, we capture your footage in incredible 4k quality.</p>
<p>With the technology available in consumer drones today, it is amazing what’s achievable. Leading the industry benchmark with an almost half an hour flight time pre battery charge, the DJI Phantom 4 provides the perfect canvas for your artwork.</p>
<p>Instead of giving you a review about the Phantom 4, I’d like to tell you about my story with DJI so far. I initially purchased a DJI Phantom 3 Professional in 2015. It was very impressive and I made quite a few customers happy with it. Fast forward to one day earlier this summer, mid-flight, my Phantom 3 decided to abandon its family here at A Nerd’s World. It just took off at full throttle, into the sky. I was in shock and disappointment. I kept wondering about how it was possible that this happened to me. I had the unit firmware up to date at all times and yet it still happened. To make matters worse, here I was stuck with an extra 8 batteries for it.</p>
<p>Going 30 Days into the future after the incident, I’d mustered the courage to invest my time, money and faith back into DJI and try the Phantom 4. I bought it, along with extra batteries and a few other goodies and took it on a trip across the United States. I had an amazing experience at <strong><a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/" target="_blank">B&amp;H Photo Video</a></strong> in Manhattan, New York. Not only were the staff extremely helpful, but the prices beat Canada by a long-shot. From there, I traveled to New Jersey, Philadelphia and finally to Washington DC, before coming back home. During this trip, I regained my confidence in DJI. The phantom has helped me capture outstanding footage, which I’ll give you a sneak peek of shortly.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to leave you with this. At A Nerd’s World, we are still the best drone service provider in Toronto.  Do you want to distinguish yourself from your competition? Instead of having a bland website like everyone else, why not add some life and realism to it with the power of video?</p>
<p>Be sure to catch a <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/drone-video-services-toronto"><strong>video our capabilities with the DJI Phantom 4 in Toronto</strong></a>, to better understand the type of quality that is achievable by this amazing drone.</p>
<p>We’re here for hire. Give us a call today at <strong>(647) 348-2020</strong> to book drone services for your event!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why HUSTLE Is Essential for Starting a Web Development Business" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMYIpb9u6x0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Successful entrepreneurs don&#8217;t wait for success to come to them &#8211; they go out and make things happen. Hustling can help you become a better entrepreneur as it helps you manage your time properly and take your own initiatives. By improving your hustle, you can take your business to the next level.</p>
<p>A strong work ethic is a vital part of being successful in your business. Work ethic is a set of values based on the ideals of discipline and hard work. Forming good habits such as focusing, staying motivated, honest with your clients, finishing tasks immediately, and more helps to create a good work ethic that will impress prospects and clients.</p>
<p>Hustling teaches you the importance of determination despite failures and roadblocks. A successful entrepreneur understands that failure, rejection, or negative feedback are not signs of stopping, but signs to keep moving forward and persevering.</p>

<p>As an entrepreneur and manager of a <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/toronto-web-design-companyweb-development"><strong>Website Development Company in Toronto</strong></a>, I’ve worked alongside many different companies.

<p>Unfortunately, most people don’t have tens of thousands of dollars for marketing or <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto"><strong>SEO</strong></a> per month, or the willingness to quit their current job to focus on this new business venture.</p>
<p>There is a proven sequence of steps you can follow to guarantee your online success when you&#8217;re starting a new website. I&#8217;ve seen thousands of people start and grow successful businesses by doing the following:</p>
<p><span style="color: #212121; font-family: 'PT Serif', TimesNewRoman, 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">1.</span> <strong>Empathy</strong> &#8211; the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Product &amp; Services</strong> &#8211; Before you start selling, you need to find the right product or service with the potential for online profitability.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Pricing</strong> &#8211; Can you compete with competitors?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Website</strong> &#8211; None of the above matters if you don’t have a properly built ecommerce store that sells your product or service and provides an intuitive shopping experience.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Traffic</strong> &#8211; Will you dedicate time in driving potential clients to your website?</p>
<p>6. <strong>Innovation</strong> &#8211; Understand weaknesses and make changes without hesitation.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Statistics</strong> &#8211; Want to succeed with your new online business? You MUST follow statistics and make changes based on actual facts!</p>

<p>In today’s global marketplace, it’s not simply enough to just have a digital presence. To capitalize on opportunity and captivate real, live, human readers, an optimized, functional, interactive website is a must. Unfortunately, the Internet is swarming with poor website designs that miss both the technical and content mark. Worse yet, clients and developers alike continuously contribute to the current outbreak of design delinquency in equal measure.</p>
<p>It’s time to end ugly websites, once and for all. Let’s take a look at how clients and developers perpetrate this trend of low-quality websites and pinpoint new design and development standards in 2018 that will help end this vicious cycle of “all-surface-no-substance” sites.</p>
<div id="article-0-inread"><strong>Clients</strong></div>
<p>A client’s unrealistic expectations can doom a website to fail before the design process even begins.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many clients have limited knowledge of what a website should look like, and more importantly, what a functional, intentional website can deliver. They underestimate the value of going beyond esthetics with their sites, assuming that build success relies solely on an appealing interface. Clients believe that, as long as their site “looks good,” it will float in cyberspace, effectively extending brand reach while magically attracting millions of interested users and converting them into customers.</p>
<p>The truth is, that’s not how website magic works.</p>
<p>To deliver digital results, a website must offer an engaging, dynamic user experience. Yes, graphics are critical to the design process. However, to optimize success, your site must provide more than compelling graphics. Your developer is or, at least should be working hard behind the scenes for you, creating a sophisticated infrastructure of both site and SEO functionality that must be developed and tested before going live. That is where the website magic truly begins.</p>
<p>A client’s budget expectations can also play a major role in launching an inferior website. When it comes to promoting your brand, it’s important to remember that you ultimately get what you pay for. Effective, intuitive website design is complicated. But the return is well worth the investment. So, clients, invest already. And trust your developer’s insight, talent, and experience as you navigate through the process to a final design that doesn’t just look great, but also achieves all of your critical online marketing goals.</p>
<p><strong>Website Developers</strong></p>
<p>Of course, clients aren’t the only ones perpetuating bad websites. Developers themselves can also contribute to the slew of poorly-designed, ineffective sites plaguing the Internet. How? It often starts by treating must-have digital marketing features as “extras” when offering site packages to clients.</p>
<p>Not cool, developers. Not cool.</p>
<p>Developers, 2018 is the year you up your game and raise the bar on acceptable industry standards. No more static, one-dimensional tactics that render a site into a mere Powerpoint presentation (aka ugly website). Going forward, refuse to work on a design that isn’t multidimensional and fully-functional. Every project you take on should have all necessary digital marketing functions to elevate both owner and user experience.</p>
<p><strong>2018 Website Feature Checklist</strong></p>

<p>Deac from Philly asks: &#8220;<em>Hey Chris, Do you have a video on your design process, maybe a 5 step video on how you go about the design process with a client.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I have a website design and development process that we follow for every single website project. This video will detail our <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/toronto-web-design-companyweb-develope"><strong>website development process</strong></a> from start to finish.</p>
<p>Almost every Web Developer and Website Designer can attest that much of their work is repetitive. We find ourselves completing the same tasks, even if slightly modified, over and over for every website project we take on. Following a detailed website design and development process can speed up your work and help your client understand your role in the project. This video tries to show how developing a process for Web design can organize a developer’s thoughts, speed up a project’s timeline and prepare a freelance business for growth.<br />

<p>What is Dropshipping? Where to find a good Dropshipper? How much money do you need to get started?</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS DROPSHIPPING?</strong></p>
<p>Dropshipping is a type of business model which enables a company to operate without maintaining inventory, owning a warehouse to store their products, or even having to ship their products to their customers themselves. How it works is that the retailer partners up with a dropship supplier that manufactures and/or warehouses products, package the products and ships them directly to the retailer’s customer, on the retailer’s behalf.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, this is how dropshipping works:</p>
<p>1. The customer places an order for a product on the retailer’s online store.<br />
2. The retailer automatically or manually forwards the order and customer details to the dropship supplier.<br />
3. The dropship supplier packages and ships the order directly to the customer in the retailer’s name.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE TO FIND A GOOD DROPSHIPPER?</strong></p>
<p>The simple answer is &#8211; Google is your friend. I used to use www.ioffer.com as a great starting point to search products, and contact sellers.</p>
<p><strong>HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED TO GET STARTED?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, you don&#8217;t need much. You only need enough to purchase a domain and hosting, plus pay for a Shopify website to get started.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE CAN I GET MY WEBSITE DESIGNED IN TORONTO?</strong></p>

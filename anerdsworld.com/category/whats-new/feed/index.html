<p>What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?</p>
<p>Search Engine Optimization (<a href="https://anerdsworld.com/new-york-city-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a>) is the process of fine-tuning a website to achieve higher rankings in search results like Google.</p>
<p><strong>My 4 Back-to-the-Basics SEO steps:</strong></p>
<p>1. Are the keywords that you want to rank for actually on your page?<br />
2. Are you worthy of a Google ranking?<br />
3. Are your website users enjoying your website and content?<br />
4. Are other websites of authority linking to you?</p>

<p>If I had $1 for every time I was asked &#8220;how long will SEO take for me to get to #1 on Google&#8221; I would be a much richer man.</p>
<p>I apologize if I offended anyone, but I&#8217;m here to motivate you to move forward with your SEO goals having realistic expectations and timelines.</p>
<p>SEO has really helped my website design business grow, but it has taken me many years of constant work to eat the fruits of my labour. Now I&#8217;m really eating (you can tell by my shape).</p>
<p>If you need assistance with your custom <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto"><strong>SEO Strategy in Toronto</strong></a> don&#8217;t hesitate to email me directly at <em>nerd@anerdsworld.com</em></p>

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aay3iMAoC3A)</a></noscript></div>
<p>Creating landing pages can be a very important step in the success of your online business and SEO strategy. Each landing page should focus <strong>on one location</strong>,<strong> industry</strong> and <strong>keyword</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember: A website page is easy to find for all users to your website and featured on your homepage plus links from menu and navigation. Whereas a landing page is only found from a Google search for the one specific keyword you are targeting (and the user has entered). Landing pages cannot be found in the general navigation of your website.</p>
<p>Example of our <em><a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto">Toronto SEO</a></em> Page &#8211; Normal website page.<br />
Example of a <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/dentist-seo-toronto/"><em>Toronto Dentist SEO</em></a> Page &#8211; Landing page built for specific SEO searches.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy today&#8217;s video!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why HUSTLE Is Essential for Starting a Web Development Business" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMYIpb9u6x0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Successful entrepreneurs don&#8217;t wait for success to come to them &#8211; they go out and make things happen. Hustling can help you become a better entrepreneur as it helps you manage your time properly and take your own initiatives. By improving your hustle, you can take your business to the next level.</p>
<p>A strong work ethic is a vital part of being successful in your business. Work ethic is a set of values based on the ideals of discipline and hard work. Forming good habits such as focusing, staying motivated, honest with your clients, finishing tasks immediately, and more helps to create a good work ethic that will impress prospects and clients.</p>
<p>Hustling teaches you the importance of determination despite failures and roadblocks. A successful entrepreneur understands that failure, rejection, or negative feedback are not signs of stopping, but signs to keep moving forward and persevering.</p>

<em>Meet the <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto"><strong>Toronto SEO agency</strong></a> that brings you traffic and leads instead of excuses.</em></p>
<p>Today we’re talking about the basics of <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto">SEO</a> and how they pertain to small business owners, in particular.</p>
<p>This post is part of my <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto">search engine optimization series</a> written for humans, not robots (hey, I like robots as much as the next guy, but sometimes you just gotta speak human).</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S SEO AGAIN?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) has become a popular subject over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs and business owners have realized the value of optimizing a website for search engine visibility.</p>
<p>By creating content that is more easily found via search engines, you end up ranking higher on Google and saving time and money.</p>
<p>If you’re a blogger, business owner, or someone with something to say on the web, you should know this stuff.</p>
<p>Frankly, it’s not as difficult or intimidating as some would lead you to believe.</p>
<p>I’ve learned a few simple tricks for SEO from people much smarter than me. And I wanted to pass them on.</p>
<p>Because of my lack of technical knowledge, I’ve tried to make these tips as simple as possible — so that other non-geek folk untrained in robot speak like me can still understand it.</p>
<p><strong>BEFORE GETTING STARTED&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Before you start writing content for search engines, you need to decide: What are you going to write about?</p>
<p>SEO is about having a laser focus, so knowing what term or phrase you want to focus on ahead of time is important. You should choose a term that is broad enough that people will search for it, but narrow so that you have a chance of getting ranked for it.  In SEO terms we call that &#8220;long tail keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, the term “Dentist” is way too general. However, “Best Dentist in Downtown Toronto” is a pretty good one.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen a term or suite of terms, it’s time to start creating content.</p>
<p><strong>THE BASICS OF SEO</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Here is a list of Search Engine Optimization basics — all the essential need-to-know stuff — for business owners, beginners, and other non-bots:</span></p>
<p><strong>#1 WRITE A GOOD TITLE</strong></p>
<p>A good page title is your bread-and-butter. It should include your keywords as close to the beginning of the title as possible.</p>
<p>You can see the page title by looking at the top of your browser window. For instance, You’ll see that mine is: “seo-for-beginners” but that I have a slightly different headline.</p>
<p>Try to keep it under 65 characters total, so that it doesn’t get cropped by search engines like Google.</p>
<p><strong>#2 BUILDING BACKLINKS</strong></p>
<p>Links are essential to growing your search engine ranking (especially others linking to your site). There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link out to other helpful articles using anchor text with your keyword or keyword phrase.</li>
<li>Get other people to link to you, either by asking or by writing great content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inbound links (or “backlinks“) are the most important, but all are helpful. A great strategy for building links (other than writing killer content) is guest posting on other websites or social media.</p>
<p><strong>#3 HOW TO USE KEYWORDS</strong></p>
<p>Choosing a keyword is one of the hardest parts of SEO. What will your article be about? Once you choose a topic that is relevant to your site’s topic, then you need to include it in a few other places:</p>
<p>&#8211; The page title and headline<br />
&#8211; In the URL<br />
&#8211; In the body of your article<br />
&#8211; In your site’s metadata<br />
&#8211; Image ALT tags</p>
<p>Use your keyword within the first paragraph of your blog post or page text. Starting off with a question is a great way to do this.</p>
<p>Also, use your keyword a handful of times in the body of your post (but not too much), linking to any relevant resources on your site or others about the topic, using anchor text with links.</p>
<p><strong>#4 HOW MUCH SHOULD I WRITE?</strong></p>
<p>Make your post the ideal length: 500-1000 words.</p>
<p>Going over 500 is fine (unless it means your readers won’t read it, which can increase your bounce rate), but less than 250 isn’t ideal.</p>
<p><strong>#5 FREQUENTLY CREATE CONTENT</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Posting frequently (more than once a week) teaches search engines to come back and check your website more regularly, which will cause your pages to rank more highly over time.</span></p>
<p><strong>#6 DON&#8217;T FORGET ABOUT METADATA</strong></p>
<p><em>Meta</em> means “information about information.” It’s the invisible stuff that search engines see about your content that your readers don’t. While this is not as important as text on your site, it is a factor.</p>
<p>Include keywords in your meta tags, as well as your page title and description. Some blog themes already do this for you. If not, find one that does or use a third-party app like a plugin to help you.</p>
<p>A free WordPress plugin that does this quite well is <a title="All in one SEO Pack" href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All in One SEO Pack</a> or <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#7 HOW TO USE PHOTOGRAPHS</strong></p>
<p>Rename the file name to include your keywords and include them in your image title, alt text, and description (this is also meta data).</p>
<p>Images can also help hold the reader’s interest and can lead them to click other content on your site, as well.</p>
<p><strong>#8 CREATING CATEGORIES</strong></p>
<p>Intelligently name your categories to focus on major keywords your blog may talk about (e.g. “Stuff” isn’t a great category name). And please rename your “uncategorized” category title to something better (for example “Miscellaneous” or “General”).</p>
<p>This builds more links to your content on your site and allows search engines to see that you’re linking to keywords on your site.</p>
<p><strong>#9 ADDING H1, H2, H3 HEADERS</strong></p>
<p>This is a little technical, but not as hard as it sounds.</p>
<p>If your site’s theme has an option for adding headings or subheads (this is a built-in feature for WordPress), then it’s no sweat. If not, all you have to do is add some simple code into the HTML section of your article.</p>
<p>You should use subheads to lead your reader through the article, but also use variations of your keywords in your H1, H2, and H3 tags. (Note: Don’t use the H1 tag in a post if your blog system pulls this from your title.)</p>
<p><strong>#10 GET SOCIAL AND USE INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, TWITTER</strong></p>
<p>While the vote is out on how much links from social networks like <a href="http://www.instagram.com/anerdsworld">Instagram</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/anerdsworld">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/anerdsworld">Twitter</a> affect SEO, it is a factor.</p>
<p>However, the more important reason is that shared content via social media gets attention (and ultimately links) from other website owners.</p>
<p>I’ve often seen that when one of my posts gets a lot of traction on Twitter, it starts acquiring backlinks within a few days.</p>

<p>What is Dropshipping? Where to find a good Dropshipper? How much money do you need to get started?</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS DROPSHIPPING?</strong></p>
<p>Dropshipping is a type of business model which enables a company to operate without maintaining inventory, owning a warehouse to store their products, or even having to ship their products to their customers themselves. How it works is that the retailer partners up with a dropship supplier that manufactures and/or warehouses products, package the products and ships them directly to the retailer’s customer, on the retailer’s behalf.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, this is how dropshipping works:</p>
<p>1. The customer places an order for a product on the retailer’s online store.<br />
2. The retailer automatically or manually forwards the order and customer details to the dropship supplier.<br />
3. The dropship supplier packages and ships the order directly to the customer in the retailer’s name.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE TO FIND A GOOD DROPSHIPPER?</strong></p>
<p>The simple answer is &#8211; Google is your friend. I used to use www.ioffer.com as a great starting point to search products, and contact sellers.</p>
<p><strong>HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED TO GET STARTED?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, you don&#8217;t need much. You only need enough to purchase a domain and hosting, plus pay for a Shopify website to get started.</p>

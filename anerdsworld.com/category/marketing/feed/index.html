										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why HUSTLE Is Essential for Starting a Web Development Business" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMYIpb9u6x0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Successful entrepreneurs don&#8217;t wait for success to come to them &#8211; they go out and make things happen. Hustling can help you become a better entrepreneur as it helps you manage your time properly and take your own initiatives. By improving your hustle, you can take your business to the next level.</p>
<p>A strong work ethic is a vital part of being successful in your business. Work ethic is a set of values based on the ideals of discipline and hard work. Forming good habits such as focusing, staying motivated, honest with your clients, finishing tasks immediately, and more helps to create a good work ethic that will impress prospects and clients.</p>
<p>Hustling teaches you the importance of determination despite failures and roadblocks. A successful entrepreneur understands that failure, rejection, or negative feedback are not signs of stopping, but signs to keep moving forward and persevering.</p>

<p>How I developed a one-of-a-kind work ethic in 4 easy steps:</p>
<p>1. Plan out your day in advance &#8211; use calendars &amp; alarm clocks.</p>
<p>2. Consistency &#8211; show up to work every single day and give 100% no matter what is happening in your personal life.</p>
<p>3. Grade yourself &#8211; recognize and work on your weaknesses.</p>
<p>4. Stop wasting time &#8211; no Facebook, no personal phone calls, no friends.</p>
<p>What motivates you in business? How would you grade your work ethic? Very big important questions to ask yourself!</p>
<p>Do you need help with your custom <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto"><strong>SEO Toronto</strong></a> Campaign or a <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/toronto-web-design-companyweb-develope"><strong>Website Design</strong></a> for your business? I&#8217;m always available to talk.</p>

<p>It all began with a single question: Could anyone start a small online business from scratch, with few resources and still be successful online?</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur and manager of a <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/toronto-web-design-companyweb-development"><strong>Website Development Company in Toronto</strong></a>, I’ve worked alongside many different companies. From early stage startups to established companies &#8211; all of our clients share one thing in common &#8212; they all want to run a successful online business and grow their brands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people don’t have tens of thousands of dollars for marketing or <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/seo-toronto"><strong>SEO</strong></a> per month, or the willingness to quit their current job to focus on this new business venture.</p>
<p>There is a proven sequence of steps you can follow to guarantee your online success when you&#8217;re starting a new website. I&#8217;ve seen thousands of people start and grow successful businesses by doing the following:</p>
<p><span style="color: #212121; font-family: 'PT Serif', TimesNewRoman, 'Times New Roman', Times, Georgia, serif;">1.</span> <strong>Empathy</strong> &#8211; the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Product &amp; Services</strong> &#8211; Before you start selling, you need to find the right product or service with the potential for online profitability.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Pricing</strong> &#8211; Can you compete with competitors?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Website</strong> &#8211; None of the above matters if you don’t have a properly built ecommerce store that sells your product or service and provides an intuitive shopping experience.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Traffic</strong> &#8211; Will you dedicate time in driving potential clients to your website?</p>
<p>6. <strong>Innovation</strong> &#8211; Understand weaknesses and make changes without hesitation.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Statistics</strong> &#8211; Want to succeed with your new online business? You MUST follow statistics and make changes based on actual facts!</p>
<p>Anyone, from newbie to seasoned online entrepreneur, can benefit from this process and if you are in need for a passionate, experienced <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/best-toronto-web-design/"><strong>Web Development team in Toronto</strong></a> please contact us today.</p>

<p>Every industry has its jargon. But some words and phrases can be unclear, unnecessary, or even offensive. Maybe some of these are words and phrases you like building into your business vocab, but use them with caution. If you’re going to offend or loose a sale, or if there’s a clearer way to say something, why not go the easy way?</p>
<p>Our little caveat: every office has different protocol. If you’re friendly with your clients, it’s not so strange to talk to them about personal issues. And if you’re in the thick of the consulting, tech, or business world, you might feel inclined to use the lingo and play along. But the joy of language is that there’s always another way to phrase something.</p>
<p>Do you want to increase sales in your business? Never say these twenty words out loud, or in email form.</p>
<p>1. Hope<br />
2. Should<br />
3. Might<br />
4. Can&#8217;t<br />
5. That’s impossible<br />
6. You misunderstood<br />
7. Are you upset?<br />
8. I&#8217;m busy at the moment<br />
9. Yes (when you don’t mean it)<br />
10. Sorry I was late<br />
11. That wasn’t my fault<br />
12. I was just doing as I was told<br />
13. I didn’t have time<br />
14. That will never work<br />
15. My bad<br />
16. But<br />
17. I assumed<br />
18. Sorry for my delay<br />
19. You’re wrong<br />
20. You’re not listening to me</p>
<p>I appreciate your time,<br />

<p>What do you want people to think of when they hear your company’s name and you are not in the room? Of course you want a strong, positive impression to come to mind. But whatever they think of, good or bad, that is your businesses brand.</p>
<p>Branding is vital to all businesses, but to the small business especially because branding is what enables you to stand out from the competition. After all, if you and the guy down the street are selling the same product, what is it that distinguishes your business? The answer is: Your brand. Your brand should communicate to potential customers why they should choose you.</p>
<p>Here at <a href="http://www.anerdsworld.com"><strong>A Nerd&#8217;s World</strong></a> &#8211; branding has played a massive role in our companies success.  We are recognized as the leader of our saturated industry in Toronto.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK99Wq0fX6g</p>
<p>If you’ve ever spent time around kids, you’ve been subjected to a barrage of the most classic of childhood queries: “<strong>Why?</strong>”</p>
<p>Even from a young age, we know intuitively that the motive behind an action is the most important piece of any story. When it comes to your business &#8212; whether you’ve already launched or if you’re still in the whiteboard phase &#8212; knowing your “why” will help you stay committed to your dream and help others get on board, too.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people become entrepreneurs: personal satisfaction, creative independence or financial autonomy &#8212; the list goes on. Yet all of these have one thing in common. At the core, they all are about freedom.</p>
<p>That freedom can come in many different forms: the freedom to make changes without waiting for corporate green lights, the freedom to offer a product or service that does business differently or maybe the literal freedom to actually make that dentist appointment once and for all.</p>
<p>What is it that drives you? The reason probably isn’t money &#8212; at least it shouldn’t be. There’s a reason that career counselors across the country ask the same time-old question: &#8220;If money were no object, what would you do?&#8221;too much to bear. This is when your “why” becomes imperative.</p>
<div id="h0mtwns2cf" class="banner-ad adbox adbox--called" data-key="a2ad">If you aren&#8217;t 100 percent committed to making your vision a reality, you won’t be impassioned enough to nurture your business through its inevitable growing pains. Businesses rarely make money right off the bat, so the dream of money alone will not be reason enough to see it through. Don’t trade in the shackles of your corporate day job for a gilded cubicle of your own making.</div>
<p>If a paycheck is just a means to end, how do you know when you’ve reached it? Is it after five years? 10? Or when you finally make a down payment on a house? The more material possessions you acquire &#8212; a car, a house, that timeshare in Vermont &#8212; the more that steady, safe paycheck becomes a crutch. So ask yourself, “Why am I doing this?”</p>
<p>Once you find an answer that speaks to your soul, the next question should be, “What am I waiting for?<br />

<p>I have 6 major factors in becoming a great salesperson outlined in this video. I hope it helps, and I always welcome any questions in the comments section.</p>
<p>Thank you to Linchpin Studio for the question (and I apologize for taking so long to respond):</p>
<p>&#8220;Words of wisdom, take action and be confident.</p>
<p>Hey Chris, where would you rank the power of confidence as a salesman? And if you have the chops and skills to back up your words, how best to release that from the self, and FEEL CONFIDENT in yourself?</p>
<p>Self-doubt can be a plague on the entrepreneur&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>You ask the questions (in the comments) and I will answer them in video format.</p>
<p>Paul45 asks,</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t flyers and business cards a little old school these days? That&#8217;s only really helping you locally so you better hope those locals are the ideal clients who are going to share your product and talk about you and that you&#8217;re targeting where you&#8217;re going. It also isn&#8217;t going to benefit you the same way social media would if you live in a small town.</p>

<p>When it comes to search engine optimization, <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/content-is-king-in-seo/"><strong>content is king</strong></a>. Producing original, targeted content on a regular basis is essential to the success of your website from an SEO standpoint. One question that clients often ask is how to produce website content that is SEO friendly. Here are my keys to <strong>writing SEO friendly content</strong>:</p>
<h4>Write for People, Not Search Engines</h4>
<p>Google and Microsoft (who own and operate Bing) are two of the most successful and innovative companies in the world. They can tell when you’re producing content that is targeted to rank highly on search engines. Instead of writing your content for the search engines, make sure that you’re writing it for people. What does that mean, exactly?</p>
<p>First of all, readability is extremely important. You shouldn’t sacrifice readability and proper grammar in order to stuff keywords into your page or blog post. If you’re writing for search engines, they’ll eventually figure you out and you’ll likely see a drop in rankings as a result. If you write content that people want to read and share with others on social media, then your website will reap the benefits.</p>
<h4>Include Keywords Early and Often (but not too often)</h4>
<p>Although your writing style should be targeted towards humans rather than <a href="http://moz.com/blog/search-engine-algorithm-basics" target="_blank">search engine algorithms</a>, it’s essential that the search engines know what your content is about. That’s why you should include keywords in your headers and in the body of the text itself. Make sure that you use the exact keywords in the text once or twice before you start using synonyms. To use A Nerd’s World as an example, if your keyword topic is “<a href="https://anerdsworld.com/web-design-services-toronto/search-engine-optimization-toronto-seo/"><strong>Toronto SEO</strong></a>”, make sure you use that exact keyword before you use synonyms like “SEO in Toronto”.</p>
<p>If you overuse keywords, the search engines will recognize and it will penalize you. It’s easy for users to recognize when content is keyword loaded, and it’s even easier for search engines.</p>
<h4>Include Links and a Video or Image</h4>
<p>Every page on your website, whether it’s a static page or blog post, should include links. If your page doesn’t have any outbound links, it’s viewed as a “<a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-terminology-orphan-and-dead-end-pages/7373/" target="_blank">dead end page</a>”. Dead end pages don’t add much value for search engines or users, so they rarely rank well from an SEO standpoint.</p>
<p>My general rule is that every page or blog post should have at least four links&#8211;two internal links (links to another page or post within your site) and two external links (links to another relevant website).</p>
<p>In addition to links, every page or post should have at least one video or image. No one wants to stare at a huge block of text. User experience matters. If you’re creating your own video to add to the page or post, make sure you say the exact keyword once or twice in the video. Search engines can pick up on it like they do with text. I recommend using YouTube since it’s owned by Google.</p>
<h4>Proofread, Proofread, Proofread</h4>
<p>This isn’t specific to writing SEO friendly content, but it’s so important to remember. Make sure your content is free of spelling errors, especially within your keywords. Search engines like websites that are an authority within their field, and it’s hard to become an authority when your content is riddled with bad grammar. Remember, readability is essential.</p>

<h4>Content is King with SEO</h4>
<p>If you’ve been on the internet lately, or anywhere but under a rock, you’ve probably heard the term “<a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-is-content-marketing/" target="_blank"><strong>content marketing</strong>.</a>”  It seems to be a trending topic on social media, but what is it exactly?  If you&#8217;re looking for a Coles Notes explanation of it (which you most likely are), content marketing focuses on consistently creating fresh, high-quality content that attracts and engages your targeted audience with the objective of driving revenue, and contributing to your bottom line (of course).    In one of our earlier posts, we mentioned that companies that prioritize blogging and release 20 original blogs per month drive their organic traffic up 800%.  Numbers don&#8217;t lie, and you don’t have to search very far to find that content marketing has proven its worth.</p>
<p>When Google Speaks, we Listen</p>
<p>Google is the world’s leading search engine, and if the higher powers at Google tell us that we need to improve the quality of our content, we need to listen.  Google drives more traffic to websites than any other search engine, and if we do anything to get ourselves on bad terms with the Google Gods, we can kiss SERPs goodbye.  The search engine&#8217;s shift toward content was in response to the high volume of traffic being directed to pages that were stuffed with keywords.  Although these sites contained popular search terms, the actual content offered no real value or relevant information to audiences.  Google ranks your site based on the quality and relevance of your content, and there are real humans that analyze and grade it on an ongoing basis.   </p>
<p>Take a look at some of our<strong> Content Marketing Tips</strong> to get a better understanding of &#8220;quality content,&#8221;  and ways you can achieve it.</p>
<p>&#8211; Content should be written at an expert level, demonstrating knowledge of the subject at hand.  It should be free of spelling and grammatical errors, and follow proper sentence structure.</p>
<p>&#8211; Relevance: before the big shift toward content, websites used <strong><a href="https://anerdsworld.com/black-hat-vs-white-hat-seo/">black hat SEO tactics</a></strong> to pull random searchers by filling their pages with popular keywords that had nothing to do with the site itself.   Now, it’s all about user experience, and creating copy that will satisfy your audience’s needs, and establish you as an influencer and primary source for information.</p>
<p>&#8211; Volume: Expecting to drive traffic by publishing one or two blogs a month, or having 100 words on your homepage is like trying to get approved for a million dollar mortgage with bad credit, and no income.  The top results in <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page" target="_blank">Search Engine Results Pages (SERP)</a></strong> usually have an average of 600 to 1000 words on a single page.  The best sources of information are contain targeted and well-supported research, which results in a higher word count&#8211;taking note of this, Google included content volume as one of its grading factors.</p>
<p>&#8211; Reputation and Accessibility:  If you don’t display an address or contact details, Google will assume you’re a spam page and aren’t a real company.  Having your contact info readily available is an easy way to earn brownie points and increase your <strong><a href="https://anerdsworld.com/what-is-local-seo/" target="_blank">local SEO</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&#8211; Fresh and Consistent:  Search engines like to see that you update your website regularly with new and relevant content.  You can compare your homepage to a storefront&#8211;if you still have your winter merchandise on display in the middle of March, you will lose the attention of potential customers walking by.  So, if your website hasn&#8217;t changed for a month, it might be overlooked by search engines.</p>
<h4>Content Marketing and SEO</h4>
<p>There is often confusion surrounding Content Marketing and SEO, with some people believing they are at war with each other, or that they are the same thing.  In reality, the two complement one another.  They fit together like two pieces of a puzzle, and both play a crucial role in your overall content strategy.  Although the quality and relevance of content are more important than ever (we can thank <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/2016/01/13/google-core-update/" target="_blank">Google’s awesome algorithm changes for that</a></span>), SEO tactics are a necessary part of delivering successful content marketing.  Content needs to be engaging and informative to attract and retain your audience, however, before it can do that, it needs to be discovered by your audience.  There is no point in creating quality content if it’s not going to be seen by anyone.  In addition to being original, fresh, and relevant, content needs to be optimized for search engines. Otherwise, it will get lost beyond the pages that searchers pay attention.  By applying some of our SEO tips when you’re developing content, you will win the hearts of your target audience, and the approval of search engines.</p>
<p>An article or blog rich in relevant keywords is guaranteed to get crawled by spiders and indexed by the main search engines.  However, producing original content that is fused with SEO tactics can be time-consuming for the novice writer.   Professional content marketers and SEO copywriters know the importance of implementing keywords into their content, without compromising its aesthetic.  Although SEO methodology and content marketing are continually evolving, both play important roles in successful content strategy.  If you’re interested in learning how to build a kick-ass content strategy for your business, or want to start driving real <strong><a href="https://anerdsworld.com/search-engine-optimization-toronto-seo/">SEO traffic to your website</a></strong>, contact us today for your <strong><a href="https://anerdsworld.com/free-seo-consultations/">free SEO consultation in Toronto</a></strong>.</p>

<p>If we go back to 5 or 6 years ago, you&#8217;d have to rent a helicopter, get permits and spend a lot of money to be able to go into the sky and get this kind of footage. You can do it today with us at a fraction of that cost and with 1 hour of notice! Using the latest <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/review-dji-phantom-4/" target="_blank"><strong>DJI Phantom 4</strong></a>, we capture your footage in incredible 4k quality.</p>
<p>With the technology available in consumer drones today, it is amazing what’s achievable. Leading the industry benchmark with an almost half an hour flight time pre battery charge, the DJI Phantom 4 provides the perfect canvas for your artwork.</p>
<p>Instead of giving you a review about the Phantom 4, I’d like to tell you about my story with DJI so far. I initially purchased a DJI Phantom 3 Professional in 2015. It was very impressive and I made quite a few customers happy with it. Fast forward to one day earlier this summer, mid-flight, my Phantom 3 decided to abandon its family here at A Nerd’s World. It just took off at full throttle, into the sky. I was in shock and disappointment. I kept wondering about how it was possible that this happened to me. I had the unit firmware up to date at all times and yet it still happened. To make matters worse, here I was stuck with an extra 8 batteries for it.</p>
<p>Going 30 Days into the future after the incident, I’d mustered the courage to invest my time, money and faith back into DJI and try the Phantom 4. I bought it, along with extra batteries and a few other goodies and took it on a trip across the United States. I had an amazing experience at <strong><a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/" target="_blank">B&amp;H Photo Video</a></strong> in Manhattan, New York. Not only were the staff extremely helpful, but the prices beat Canada by a long-shot. From there, I traveled to New Jersey, Philadelphia and finally to Washington DC, before coming back home. During this trip, I regained my confidence in DJI. The phantom has helped me capture outstanding footage, which I’ll give you a sneak peek of shortly.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to leave you with this. At A Nerd’s World, we are still the best drone service provider in Toronto.  Do you want to distinguish yourself from your competition? Instead of having a bland website like everyone else, why not add some life and realism to it with the power of video?</p>
<p>Be sure to catch a <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/drone-video-services-toronto"><strong>video our capabilities with the DJI Phantom 4 in Toronto</strong></a>, to better understand the type of quality that is achievable by this amazing drone.</p>
<p>We’re here for hire. Give us a call today at <strong>(647) 348-2020</strong> to book drone services for your event!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/158123825">http://vimeo.com/158123825</a></p>
<p>When it comes to search engine optimization, <a href="https://anerdsworld.com/content-is-king-in-seo/"><strong>content is king</strong></a>. Producing original, targeted content on a regular basis is essential to the success of your website from an SEO standpoint. One question that clients often ask is how to produce website content that is SEO friendly. Here are my keys to <strong>writing SEO friendly content</strong>:</p>
<h4>Write for People, Not Search Engines</h4>
<p>Google and Microsoft (who own and operate Bing) are two of the most successful and innovative companies in the world. They can tell when you’re producing content that is targeted to rank highly on search engines. Instead of writing your content for the search engines, make sure that you’re writing it for people. What does that mean, exactly?</p>
<p>First of all, readability is extremely important. You shouldn’t sacrifice readability and proper grammar in order to stuff keywords into your page or blog post. If you’re writing for search engines, they’ll eventually figure you out and you’ll likely see a drop in rankings as a result. If you write content that people want to read and share with others on social media, then your website will reap the benefits.</p>
<h4>Include Keywords Early and Often (but not too often)</h4>
<p>Although your writing style should be targeted towards humans rather than <a href="http://moz.com/blog/search-engine-algorithm-basics" target="_blank">search engine algorithms</a>, it’s essential that the search engines know what your content is about. That’s why you should include keywords in your headers and in the body of the text itself. Make sure that you use the exact keywords in the text once or twice before you start using synonyms. To use A Nerd’s World as an example, if your keyword topic is “<a href="https://anerdsworld.com/web-design-services-toronto/search-engine-optimization-toronto-seo/"><strong>Toronto SEO</strong></a>”, make sure you use that exact keyword before you use synonyms like “SEO in Toronto”.</p>
<p>If you overuse keywords, the search engines will recognize and it will penalize you. It’s easy for users to recognize when content is keyword loaded, and it’s even easier for search engines.</p>
<h4>Include Links and a Video or Image</h4>
<p>Every page on your website, whether it’s a static page or blog post, should include links. If your page doesn’t have any outbound links, it’s viewed as a “<a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-terminology-orphan-and-dead-end-pages/7373/" target="_blank">dead end page</a>”. Dead end pages don’t add much value for search engines or users, so they rarely rank well from an SEO standpoint.</p>
<p>My general rule is that every page or blog post should have at least four links&#8211;two internal links (links to another page or post within your site) and two external links (links to another relevant website).</p>
<p>In addition to links, every page or post should have at least one video or image. No one wants to stare at a huge block of text. User experience matters. If you’re creating your own video to add to the page or post, make sure you say the exact keyword once or twice in the video. Search engines can pick up on it like they do with text. I recommend using YouTube since it’s owned by Google.</p>
<h4>Proofread, Proofread, Proofread</h4>
<p>This isn’t specific to writing SEO friendly content, but it’s so important to remember. Make sure your content is free of spelling errors, especially within your keywords. Search engines like websites that are an authority within their field, and it’s hard to become an authority when your content is riddled with bad grammar. Remember, readability is essential.</p>
<p>Writing SEO friendly content is only the first step to SEO success. If you’d like to learn more about how you can optimize your website for search engines, we offer Toronto SEO tutorials starting at $120.

<p>Did you have a lemonade stand when you were a kid? Remember how you felt as you were setting it up? Excited? A little scared, perhaps? I bet you couldn’t wait for that very first sale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as we become adults we have a tendency to ignore the voice of our inner child until it, along with lemonade stands become a distant memory.  After being in business for a while, things can get a little stale. If you want to regain that magic you felt as a young entrepreneur, I have a few tips to get you started.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a young kid who dreams of doing something incredible or a veteran with an extensive entrepreneurial résumé, we all need motivation. Skipping past the cat videos, one of the greatest sources of motivation is <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and I watch them every single day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/137561387" width="894" height="502" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Chris Hughes is a self-professed nerd. He employs 15 more nerds at his <strong>Toronto web design</strong> store and head office. Despite the “nerd” moniker, everything Chris does seems motivated by art, not technology. He refers to his staff as artists, and his focus is clearly on the artistry that he and his team bring to web development and graphic design.</p>
<p>A Nerd’s World is built on passion. Owner Chris says, “I opened this store to be a one-stop shop for everything I love in life.” His passion for design, art, photography, charity and business becomes apparent as soon as you enter A Nerd’s World.</p>
<div class="stories-quote">“I want to build a proper website for your business that is going to let you grow for the future.”- Chris Hughes, owner</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Helping Others Succeed Online</h2>
<p>Chris made his first million selling T-shirts online. He modelled his business on the best practices he saw on the web, and then decided he wanted to offer those same possibilities to others. In his words, “I like business, and I enjoy helping other businesses succeed.”</p>
<p>A Nerd’s World offers services that people and companies need to thrive online. In addition to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.anerdsworld.com/toronto-web-design-companyweb-development/">Toronto web design</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.anerdsworld.com/toronto-graphic-design-firm-logo/">graphic design</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.anerdsworld.com/toronto-graphic-designers-for-logo-corporate-identity-and-branding/">custom logo design</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.anerdsworld.com/best-photo-studios-toronto/">photography</a></span>, the company also offers the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.anerdsworld.com/search-engine-optimization-toronto-seo/">best SEO in Toronto</a></span>. Chris’s company focuses on developing custom solutions based on a commitment to true craftsmanship to provide permanent solutions for his clients.</p>
<p>The dedication to art is palpable in the gallery space. One wall displays all of the company’s recent hand-designed logos; the wall is updated regularly to showcase the artists’ newest work. Chris’s pride in his staff is clear when he says, “We are not a cookie cutter company. We don’t use templates. Everything is from scratch. For all of these, a graphic designer sketches it out by hand.”</p>
<h2>The Toronto Store that Doesn’t Sell Anything</h2>
<p>With a smile, Chris will tell you, “We don’t sell anything — which was difficult to sell to my wife when we got this location.” Although it looks like a storefront, A Nerd’s World functions as an office for the designers and a gallery to showcase the passions of the owner.</p>
<p>When you walk in the door, the wall to the right is adorned with photos of community members. Chris is very conscious of the community around him on Bathurst Street. In fact, much of his business comes from walk-ins. The photos are all of interesting characters who wandered past the store in the course of a day when he was first decorating.</p>
<p>The other wall displays a tribute to a place and a cause that Chris cares about deeply, while also showcasing his love of photography: the life of the people of Santiago de Cuba. It is a small village where people live without electricity or running water. Instead of taking traditional holidays, when Chris takes time off he does charity work around the world. Chris has visited this village seven times to donate his time and his money, and his love of the place permeates the display.</p>
<p>The rest of the space is dominated by a highly impressive camera collection. The cameras are old, ranging from decades to over a century in age. The collection includes rarities like a WWI stereoscopic camera that has received international press.</p>
<p>A Nerd’s World is a place where art, business, philanthropy and the Internet come together in a gallery and storefront that sells nothing. There is no other place like it.</p>

He got his makeup done to look like a wax sculpture and set up shop in Madame Tussauds wax museum. He also roamed the streets of Los Angeles and confused many onlookers.</p>

<p>Nerds have many skills, but public speaking isn’t one of them. We filmed individual profiles of everyone at A Nerd’s World (<a title="A Nerd's World" href="https://anerdsworld.com/website-design-company-toronto/">found here</a>) to give our clients a better understanding of who we are. However, as we were filming, we started to amass a trove of unintentionally funny and embarrassing moments that we simply couldn’t delete. So grab some popcorn, kick your feet up, and enjoy the bloopers.</p>

<p>When it comes to marketing, sometimes we need to loosen our ties and get a little crazy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4mMya-aD7o"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12858" src="https://anerdsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/video-importance-website.jpg" alt="video-importance-website" width="624" height="351" /></a><br />
Having videos on your website is very important, especially if your business deals with a subject many people find boring, such as website development. The use of videos on your website will also help page rank and your overall search engine optimization. Here are some key reasons why having videos for your website is important.</p>
<p>Allows You to Engage Website Visitors<br />
Videos on your business website will allow you to engage with your website visitors. The more they feel involved in your business the more likely they are to use your business. People often would rather watch a video than have to read through a large amount of text. You will need to make sure your video is not too long and not too short. A video that is too short may not give enough information and one that is too long may lead to your website visitors losing interest in it. You will also want to make sure your video is interesting and easy to understand without making people feel like you are talking down to them.</p>
<p>Explains Products or Services<br />
If your business offers products or services many people aren’t familiar with, a video is a great way to explain it to them in a way that will hold their interest and get them enthusiastic. Difficult to understand topics can be a turn off for many website visitors. The better your video explains your products or services, the more likely your website visitors are to do business with you. A short, concise video explaining how your products or services work can be very effective in driving up your sales numbers.</p>
<p>Videos Are Social Media Friendly<br />
When you include videos on your business website or YouTube channel, give your website visitors a way to share the videos with others through social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. This will help drive more Internet traffic to your business website and will get people talking about the products and services you offer. Since so many people use social media these days it can be your greatest (and cheapest) advertising tool. Create videos for your business that people will feel compelled to share with family and friends and your customers will become your advertisers as well.</p>
<p>Stands Out From the Competition<br />
No matter what industry you are in you have competition from other businesses. Having videos gives you a competitive edge over the businesses that don’t use videos to their advantage. Not only will your business itself stand out, so will your business website. Videos are an easy way to lend more credibility to your business and cause consumers to take notice of your business. Stay one step ahead of your competition and you will have a better shot at success.</p>

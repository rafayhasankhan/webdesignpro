This is a question that i&#8217;ve been asked time and time again\u00a0with\u00a0the rapid surge of social media and online marketing. While many businesses have completely migrated their advertising efforts to the web driven by its cost effective nature, exposure potential, and convenience &#8211; print still maintains its stance as a powerful and necessary component of any ad campaign or marketing push here at\u00a0A Nerd&#8217;s World in 2015. Let\u2019s take a closer look at print media and some advantages it has over its digital counterparts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tangibility<\/strong> \u2013 A printed advertisement is a physical thing. Magazines, newspapers, menus, flyers and business cards can stay in houses or offices for months or years, while Internet ads will disappear into cyber space instantaneously.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Credibility<\/strong> \u2013 There is something about print that gives your business a sense of legitimacy. The overwhelming bombardment\u00a0of popups and banner ads on the web can be overwhelming and the fear of spam and viruses is enough to make people wary of clicking. There is no imminent danger in a print ad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Branding<\/strong> \u2013 Print ads are excellent aid in\u00a0solidifying your brand identity. Your ads should have a consistent aesthetic in terms of fonts, colors and types of images to establish brand recognition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Target Marketing<\/strong> \u2013 Placing ads in publications such as specialty magazines can effectively reach niche audiences that may be more difficult to target online.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More Engaging<\/strong> \u2013 Consumers are more engaged when reading printed material, unlike websites, which are often skimmed in as little as 15 seconds. A study also shows that people read digital screen text 20% \u2013 30% slower than printed paper.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Less Print Ads<\/strong> \u2013 With more and more businesses relying solely on the Internet for their advertising needs, the decline of print publication can actually be used as a marketing advantage. Publications are less crowded, allowing more room for your ad to shine, and possibly even cheaper prices for that ad space.<\/p>\n<p>Are you looking for a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.anerdsworld.com\/website-design-company-toronto\/\">creative agency in Toronto<\/a><\/span> to help design your print ad?

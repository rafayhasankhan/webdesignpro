In my experience, it&#8217;s a bit like driving through a heavy fog where you are only able to see a few feet in front of the windshield &#8212; you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up ahead until it&#8217;s upon you. However, the longer you are an entrepreneur, the better you can navigate through that fog.<\/p>\n<p>My Top 15 Things to do when Starting a Business:<\/p>\n<p>1. Choose an industry that you enjoy.<br \/>\n2. Duck a detailed business plan.<br \/>\n3. Do not wait for a sign from above.<br \/>\n4. You should probably ignore your friend\u2019s and family\u2019s business advice.<br \/>\n5. Legitimize your hustle: Get registered!<br \/>\n6. Test the water or take a leap of faith?<br \/>\n7. Reverse engineer success.<br \/>\n8. Avoid the dangers of perfectionism.<br \/>\n9. Do you want to be successful? Prepare to fail!<br \/>\n10. Hustle like your livelihood depends on it.<br \/>\n11. Never underestimate a little bit of money.<br \/>\n12. The business pivot: Change direction overnight.<br \/>\n13. Avoid unnecessary investors and partners.<br \/>\n14. Why thinking small is the secret to big business.<br \/>\n15. Ignore everything I said. Figure it out for yourself along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need help with your new business?

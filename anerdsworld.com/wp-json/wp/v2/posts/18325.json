As a client, you know exactly who is going to be working on your website or taking your headshot. We believe our approach to business makes us more personal and creates a level of accountability that is lacking from our competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Just because someone is wearing a nice suit doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they are good at what they do. We believe that professionalism comes from the quality of our work not the quality of the clothes we wear. We\u2019ve created a casual and relaxed environment for our customers, making them feel comfortable, and promoting an open dialogue between us.<\/p>\n<p>We are proudly 100% in house and don\u2019t outsource any of our work. At A Nerd\u2019s World we don\u2019t like to use the word employee, we prefer the word artist. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/website-design-company-toronto\/\">On our about us page we have all of our artist\u2019s full names, photos, and a mini biography about each of them<\/a><\/strong>. We feel like expressing ourselves to our clients allows them to feel comfortable expressing themselves to us.<\/p>\n<p>We are a counter to the corporate world of stock images and suits. We may come in to a meeting in khakis and a t-shirt. But, we are experienced and knowledgeable, and at the end of the day we put more importance on that than our clothing.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18326\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM.png\" alt=\"A Nerd's World - 986 Bathurst Street\" width=\"1192\" height=\"1192\" srcset=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM.png 1192w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-400x400.png 400w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-146x146.png 146w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-50x50.png 50w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-576x576.png 576w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-80x80.png 80w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-85x85.png 85w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-07-at-7.09.51-AM-75x75.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1192px) 100vw, 1192px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One of the things that sets us apart from other <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/toronto-web-design-companyweb-development\/\">Toronto web design firms<\/a><\/strong> is our 986 Bathurst location, a walk-in boutique style office. Our clients can drop by to sit on our bar stools and inquire about their current project, schedule a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/toronto-commercial-photographer\/\">corporate headshot<\/a><\/strong>, or talk about a website they\u2019d like made. Unlike a lot of other web design firms where you only communicate with them via a phone call, an email, or Skype, we allow people the ability to have a good old fashion face-to-face conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Giving your company more personality allows it to stand out from a crowd. If you are the face of your company, you are using your individuality to your advantage.

For a lot of businesses\u2019 their employees\u2019 individuality has been an untapped resource.<\/p>\n<p>And remember we also have <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/barrie-web-design\/\">Barrie Web Design<\/a><\/strong>, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/oakville-web-design\/\">Oakville Web Design<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/web-design-mississauga\/\">Mississauga Web Design<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0services.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15181\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/signature1.png\" alt=\"chris-signature\" width=\"200\" height=\"48\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Chris A.

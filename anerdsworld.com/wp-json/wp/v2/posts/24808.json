Unfortunately, helping search engines find and rank your website for inclusion in it&#8217;s listings is somewhat challenging. Like many online strategies, there are tricks and tasks that you can use to improve your results. However, similar to social media marketing, you can spend an inordinate amount of time on search engine optimization. Here are 11 do it yourself tips on how to get your website noticed in search engines legitimately, without spending to much time.<\/p>\n<p>1. ONE TOPIC PER PAGE &#8211;<br \/>\nYou can certainly have a page that lists all your products and services, but you also need a website page for each topic.<\/p>\n<p>2. BASIC PAGE OPTIMIZATION &#8211;<br \/>\nThe purpose of the given website page should be directly stated in all of the following areas using the keyword you\u2019re targeting:<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6 Content<br \/>\n\u25e6 URL<br \/>\n\u25e6 Word Count &#8211; 500+ words of focused content on a page<br \/>\n\u25e6 Image Name &amp; ALT Text<\/p>\n<p>3. OUTBOUND LINKS &#8211;<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s not just who links to you that&#8217;s important, but where you link to. This can affect both relevance and trust by Google. If you&#8217;re linking out to on-topic sites from your content that&#8217;s a good indication that the content is relevant to the terms in question. Also, linking out to low quality websites will send a negative signal to Google.<\/p>\n<p>4. INTERNAL LINKS &#8211;<br \/>\nIs a type of hyperlink on a website page to another page or resource on the same website or domain. A lack of internal links can seriously hamper a page&#8217;s ability to get crawled by Google and ranked.<\/p>\n<p>5. ANCHOR TEXT &#8211;<br \/>\nThe anchor text, link label, link text, or link title is the visible, clickable text in a hyperlink. The words contained in the anchor text can determine the ranking that the website page will receive on Google.<\/p>\n<p>6. UPLOADS PER MONTH (UPM) &#8211;<br \/>\nYou don\u2019t have to begin posting content every day &#8211; I understand it\u2019s unrealistic for many website owners. But I recommend that you upload your own content regularly. Remember, content does not need to be text. For example, a photographer could add a new portfolio images with short textual descriptions.<\/p>\n<p>7. LOCAL DIRECTORIES &#8211;<br \/>\nA local business listing is an online entry that contains your business Name, Address and Phone Number (NAP) along with other details. There are a lot of directories and websites like Yelp, Foursquare and Yellow Pages where local businesses can create free local business listings.<\/p>\n<p>8. NAP &#8211;<br \/>\nStands for Name, Address, Phone Number. NAP is critical for businesses wishing to rank well in the local organic search results, because search engines like Google take the data into account when determining which companies to show for geo-targeted searches.<\/p>\n<p>9. GOOGLE VERIFIED BUSINESS &#8211;<br \/>\nA Google My Business listing is an absolute essential for local search. It&#8217;s free to set up, it&#8217;s one of the best things you can do to improve local <a href=\"\/seo-toronto\">SEO<\/a> visibility.<\/p>\n<p>10. GOOGLE REVIEWS &#8211;<br \/>\nBusiness reviews from clients and customers can be seen as one of the most powerful ways of promoting trust and confidence in your business in the eyes of Google.<\/p>\n<p>11. Get GOOGLED! &#8211;<br \/>\nCreate curiosity and create a reason for people to search your business name on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need help with your <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/seo-toronto\">SEO in Toronto<\/a><\/strong>? or <a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/new-york-city-seo\"><strong>SEO in New York City<\/strong><\/a>?

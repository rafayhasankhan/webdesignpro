We specialized in everything from refurbished electronics, cookware, and apparel. My boss was my mentor, his name was Benji. He\u00a0taught me valuable lessons in running a business. The company at its height had 15 stores across the GTA. He would open a store beside his biggest competitors who had the budget for advertising. Each Factory Outlet Club was situated in prime locations that already had the target customers because of the main retailer that was settled in the area. Besides the big budget his competitors had to promote their business with advertisements, Benji had a simpler approach with signage and balloons that caught everyone\u2019s attention. He spent approximately $250 on helium balloons monthly per store and it would draw crowds of new customers outside of the store everyday.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18258\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business.jpg\" alt=\"Balloons on Bathurst - A Nerd's World\" width=\"1000\" height=\"956\" srcset=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business-400x382.jpg 400w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business-768x734.jpg 768w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business-153x146.jpg 153w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business-50x48.jpg 50w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business-576x551.jpg 576w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/balloons-for-business-78x75.jpg 78w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>I carry on the lessons I\u2019ve learned from my previous workplace and implement it into A Nerd\u2019s World. There are thousands of stores fighting for attention and it is my daily goal to make us stand out on one of the busiest streets of Toronto. It is a gloomy day in the city but you\u2019ll always notice the bright balloons outside of our shop &#8211; rain or shine. We rent a helium tank from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blowit.ca\/helium-tank-rentals-c-34.html\" target=\"_blank\">Blow It<\/a>. which gets re-filled every two weeks for $100. The investment is small for such a simple way to draw attention to the traffic that drives down Bathurst st. Whether it be my children\u2019s birthday parties or promoting A Nerd\u2019s World, balloons create excitement for any environment. Any small business around the world has the budget for balloons. It is a small price to pay to gain walk-in traffic and new customers. To make your business a success, you must work hard at it everyday.<\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15181\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/signature1.png\" alt=\"chris-signature\" width=\"200\" height=\"48\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Chris A.

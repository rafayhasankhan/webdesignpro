When optimizing a site to increase its SERP rank, it is important to apply the same principles.\u00a0 When a site is optimized, various techniques of SEO are applied in order to achieve the desired result.<\/p>\n<p>The White Hat technique creates content for users, focusing on its relevance and quality of writing, as well as its usability and readability.\u00a0 It follows the same basic principles and guidelines of SEO, ensuring that the content indexed by search engines is also visible to users.\u00a0 <strong>White Hat SEO<\/strong> incorporates internal cross-linking on websites and inbound links from relevant, reputable sources and is approved by search engines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Black Hat SEO<\/strong> drives traffic to sites through unethical methods not approved by search engines, and unlike other techniques, does not comply with SEO standards.\u00a0 These practices go against current search engine guidelines, by using \u2018hacks\u2019 to drive traffic to sites.\u00a0 This yields quick results, however, becomes problematic in the long-term.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The following are examples of Black Hat techniques:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>1. Spamdexing \u2013 When irrelevant phrases are repeated to influence resources indexed by search engines<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0Keyword Stuffing \u2013 The addition of several keywords to manipulate SERP.\u00a0 Content appears to be redundant and its writing style lacks in quality.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Invisible Iframes \u2013 When the page that appears to users is not hosted by the webpage\u2019s company, allowing software to be downloaded without the user\u2019s knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0Invisible Text \u2013 Hiding keywords on a site by making the font color the same as page\u2019s background.\u00a0 This attracts search engine spiders, however, is not immediately visible to humans.<\/p>\n<p>5. Fake Doorway Pages \u2013 Pages that are not visible to users because they don\u2019t actually exist.\u00a0 Again, another that attracts search spiders in order increase the site\u2019s index.<\/p>\n<p>SEO has become a necessity in every skilled digital marketer\u2019s arsenal.\u00a0 Due the significance of SEO, major search engines are constantly developing new methods to weed out those who abuse it. With the ongoing evolution of digital trends, it is important to implement ethical techniques and search engine approved practices to maintain your website\u2019s, and company\u2019s reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need help with your <a title=\"Toronto Search Engine Optimization\" href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/services\/search-engine-optimization-toronto-seo\/\"><strong>Toronto Search Engine Optimization<\/strong><\/a>?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15181\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/signature1.png\" alt=\"chris-signature\" width=\"200\" height=\"48\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Chris A.

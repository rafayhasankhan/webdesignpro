Civilians being wounded and killed are commonplace in the West Bank.<\/p>\n<p>Questions surrounding the tension between Palestine and Israel have been a complex subject, often with no straight answer.\u00a0 Although I am back at A\u00a0Nerd\u2019s World, fulfilling my duties as the owner of my business, I have more questions about the West Bank now than before I had left.\u00a0 The experience changed me and the way I view the lives of the people in North America.\u00a0 I see people complain about the length of lines at Starbucks, yet will still wait ten minutes or more for a caffeine fix.\u00a0 I hear people blaring their horns because they\u2019ve spent ten minutes stuck in traffic.<\/p>\n<p>What I am sharing with you is only ten minutes of footage\u2014yet with very few words, it speaks volumes to me.\u00a0 People are entitled to their own opinions, ones that are formed around the obscurity shared by the media.\u00a0 I\u2019m not here to shape your views, but I do know one thing is for certain\u2014my perception of what can happen in ten minutes will never be the same.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15181\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/signature1.png\" alt=\"chris-signature\" width=\"200\" height=\"48\" \/><br \/> Chris A.

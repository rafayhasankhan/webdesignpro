People will choose to be a customer of a business based on positive reviews, and decide to avoid a company altogether because of negative ones. Today, the vast majority of people get their information from the internet, and as a result rely on services such as Google Reviews and Yelp as a way to decide where to take their business. For small companies, it has never been more important to have positive reviews on these services than ever before.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19176\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/importance-of-google-reviews.jpg\" alt=\"Google Reviews Important for SEO?\" width=\"662\" height=\"773\" srcset=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/importance-of-google-reviews.jpg 662w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/importance-of-google-reviews-343x400.jpg 343w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/importance-of-google-reviews-125x146.jpg 125w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/importance-of-google-reviews-43x50.jpg 43w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/importance-of-google-reviews-64x75.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At A Nerd\u2019s World we put an emphasis on customer satisfaction and are proud of our rating on Google reviews. It brings me a feeling of accomplishment to see that a customer is happy with our work. \u00a0We always make an effort to do the best work possible, and it is incredibly meaningful when a customer makes a note of this and recommends someone else to use our service.<\/p>\n<p>As a small business owner, if you haven\u2019t already, I would strongly recommend that you register your business on <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.ca\/business\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s \u2018My Business\u2019<\/a><\/strong>. This will allow you to put your location, hours-of-operation, and contact information. It is incredibly important for you to focus on the way your business is viewed in the public eye. If someone were to search for your business on Google, the first thing they would see is reviews. One way you can improve your online review presence is incentives for patrons of your business to review you online. If you are a coffee shop, perhaps you should offer a free latte for anyone who leaves you a review. You should set goals for yourself every week and try to achieve them, two reviews a week may be a reasonable goal for your business.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19178\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fight-negative-feedback.jpg\" alt=\"Fight fake google feedback\" width=\"662\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fight-negative-feedback.jpg 662w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fight-negative-feedback-400x209.jpg 400w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fight-negative-feedback-260x136.jpg 260w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fight-negative-feedback-50x26.jpg 50w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/fight-negative-feedback-143x75.jpg 143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><br \/>\nThere is complete anonymity in online reviews, that means there is a real possibility that competitors will leave fake reviews to try to hurt your business. It is definitely frustrating to have someone post a fake review, lying about your company, but it is an unfortunate result of the high level of accessibility. No-one is immune from this &#8212; Even we\u2019ve had a fake review, but it is just as important to respond to the good reviews as it is to respond to the bad ones. There is not much that can be done other than responding to the claims the person wrote, but in most cases the damage has already been done to your rating. My advice to businesses who\u2019ve received fake reviews would be to continue to get more reviews to reduce the effect of the fake review has on your average rating and not to spend too much time worrying about it.<\/p>\n<p>Since the word is out that we\u2019ve helped hundreds of businesses achieve high-levels of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/web-design-services-toronto\/search-engine-optimization-toronto-seo\/\">Toronto SEO success<\/a><\/strong><\/span>, our referrals are higher than ever in 2016.

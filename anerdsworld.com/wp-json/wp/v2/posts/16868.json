That said, it&#8217;s likely not something much of the general public knows a whole lot about. We&#8217;re surrounded by brand based influence every day. From the golden arches of McDonald&#8217;s to the bright red tone we all recognize immediately as being an ice cold Coca-Cola &#8211; logo design, logo design, logo design! Each and every brand, meticulously crafted to gain our confidence (hopefully from an honest and integrity driven perspective more times than not).<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>Today I sat down for a couple minutes to go over just what goes into a logo, albeit somewhat awkwardly. I&#8217;m a logo designer in Toronto, not an L.A. actor! From initial pencil to paper sketches, to final vectors in all their bright and colorful glory, I touch on the basics of brand design. In forthcoming videos we&#8217;ll get into specifics to further explore this whole thing but for now, enjoy watching me squirm&#8230; and hopefully learn a thing or two about <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.anerdsworld.com\/toronto-graphic-designers-for-logo-corporate-identity-and-branding\/\">affordable logo design<\/a><\/strong> in Toronto or anywhere for that matter.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA professional business should look professional. New business owners often invest a lot of time and money in property and equipment, but do not often match it by investing suitably in their logo.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common reasons why many logos look amateurish:<\/p>\n<p>1. The business owner wanted to save money by designing the logo quickly themselves.<br \/>\n2. A friend or relative who claims to know a little about graphic design does it as a favor.<br \/>\n3. The wrong people are commissioned. (Local printers are not likely proficient in logo design.)<br \/>\n4. The business outsourced the job via one of several design competition websites, which are mostly populated by amateur designers.<br \/>\n5. The job was given to an online company that offers $99 cheap logos.All of the above can result in disastrous outcomes. If your logo looks amateurish, then so will your business. A business should know where to look when it wants a new logo. <\/p>\n<p>A Nerd&#8217;s World offers great insight on how to choose the right logo design for your business.

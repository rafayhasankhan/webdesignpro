And I wanted to pass them on.<\/p>\n<p>Because of my lack of technical knowledge, I\u2019ve tried to make these tips as simple as possible \u2014 so that other non-geek folk untrained in robot speak like me can still understand it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE GETTING STARTED&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before you start writing content for search engines, you need to decide: What are you going to write about?<\/p>\n<p>SEO is about having a laser focus, so knowing what term or phrase you want to focus on ahead of time is important.\u00a0You should choose a term that is broad enough that people will search for it, but narrow so that you have a chance of getting ranked for it. \u00a0In SEO terms we call that &#8220;long tail keywords&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the term \u201cDentist\u201d is way too general. However, \u201cBest Dentist in Downtown Toronto\u201d is a pretty good one.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen a term or suite of terms, it\u2019s time to start creating content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE BASICS OF SEO<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Here is a list of Search Engine Optimization basics \u2014 all the essential need-to-know stuff \u2014 for business owners, beginners, and other non-bots:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#1 WRITE A GOOD TITLE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A good page title is your bread-and-butter. It should include your keywords as close to the beginning of the title as possible.<\/p>\n<p>You can see the page title by looking at the top of your browser window. For instance, You\u2019ll see that mine is: \u201cseo-for-beginners\u201d but that I have a slightly different headline.<\/p>\n<p>Try to keep it under 65 characters total, so that it doesn\u2019t get cropped by search engines like Google.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2 BUILDING BACKLINKS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Links are essential to growing your search engine ranking (especially others linking to your site). There are two ways to do this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Link out to other helpful articles using anchor text with your keyword or keyword phrase.<\/li>\n<li>Get other people to link to you, either by asking or by writing great content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Inbound links (or \u201cbacklinks\u201c) are the most important, but all are helpful. A great strategy for building links (other than writing killer content) is guest posting on other websites or social media.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3 HOW TO USE KEYWORDS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Choosing a keyword is one of the hardest parts of SEO. What will your article be about? Once you choose a topic that is relevant to your site\u2019s topic, then you need to include it in a few other places:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The page title and headline<br \/>\n&#8211; In the URL<br \/>\n&#8211; In the body of your article<br \/>\n&#8211; In your site\u2019s metadata<br \/>\n&#8211; Image ALT tags<\/p>\n<p>Use your keyword\u00a0within the first paragraph of your blog post or page text.\u00a0Starting off with a question is a great way to do this.<\/p>\n<p>Also, use your keyword a handful of times in the body of your post (but not too much), linking to any relevant resources on your site or others about the topic, using anchor text with links.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#4 HOW MUCH SHOULD I WRITE?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make your post the ideal length: 500-1000 words.<\/p>\n<p>Going over 500 is fine (unless it means your readers won\u2019t read it, which can increase your bounce rate), but less than 250 isn\u2019t ideal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#5 FREQUENTLY CREATE CONTENT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Posting frequently (more than once a week) teaches search engines to come back and check your website more regularly, which will cause your pages to rank more highly over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#6 DON&#8217;T FORGET ABOUT METADATA<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Meta<\/em> means \u201cinformation about information.\u201d It\u2019s the invisible stuff that search engines see about your content that your readers don\u2019t. While this is not as important as text on your site, it is a factor.<\/p>\n<p>Include keywords in your meta tags, as well as your\u00a0page title and description. Some blog themes already do this for you. If not, find one that does or use a third-party app like a plugin to help you.<\/p>\n<p>A free WordPress plugin that does this quite well is <a title=\"All in one SEO Pack\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/all-in-one-seo-pack\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">All in One SEO Pack<\/a>\u00a0or <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/\">Yoast<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#7 HOW TO USE PHOTOGRAPHS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rename the file name to include your keywords and include them in your image title, alt text, and description (this is also meta data).<\/p>\n<p>Images can also help hold the reader\u2019s interest and can lead them to click other content on your site, as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#8 CREATING CATEGORIES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Intelligently name your categories to focus on major keywords your blog may talk about (e.g. \u201cStuff\u201d isn\u2019t a great category name). And please rename your \u201cuncategorized\u201d category title to something better (for example \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cGeneral\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>This builds more links to your content on your site and allows search engines to see that you\u2019re linking to keywords on your site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#9 ADDING H1, H2, H3 HEADERS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a little technical, but not as hard as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>If your site\u2019s theme has an option for adding headings or subheads (this is a built-in feature for WordPress), then it\u2019s no sweat. If not, all you have to do is add some simple code into the HTML section of your article.<\/p>\n<p>You should use subheads to lead your reader through the article, but also use variations of your keywords in your H1, H2, and H3 tags. (Note: Don\u2019t use the H1 tag in a post if your blog system pulls this from your title.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>#10 GET SOCIAL AND USE INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, TWITTER<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While the vote is out on how much links from social networks like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/anerdsworld\">Instagram<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/anerdsworld\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/anerdsworld\">Twitter<\/a> affect SEO,\u00a0it is a factor.<\/p>\n<p>However, the more important reason is that shared content via social media gets attention (and ultimately links) from other website owners.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve often seen that when one of my posts gets a lot of traction on Twitter, it starts acquiring backlinks within a few days.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need help with your <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/seo-toronto\">SEO in Toronto<\/a><\/strong>? or <a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/new-york-city-seo\"><strong>SEO in New York City<\/strong><\/a>?

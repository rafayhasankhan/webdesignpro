All campaigns, however, start in the same place\u2014with keyword research. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Keyword_research\" target=\"_blank\">Keyword research<\/a> is the practice SEO professionals use to identify what terms consumers are searching for in search engines. By researching and identifying these terms, SEO professionals (like me!) are able to put together detailed optimization campaigns that can target highly competitive keywords while also identifying areas of opportunity that competitors may have missed.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a Keyword?<\/h3>\n<p>A keyword, in SEO jargon, is a phrase that people search for on search engines in order to find a good or service. To use as an example, if you were looking for a company to design and develop your website, you might search \u201cweb development\u201d. That entire phrase is considered a keyword.<\/p>\n<p>If you were looking for the best web design company in Toronto to develop your site, you might search \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/toronto-web-design-companyweb-development\/\"><strong>best web development Toronto<\/strong><\/a>\u201d. This is considered a \u201clong-tail\u201d keyword. \u201cWeb development\u201d is the base term, while \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cToronto\u201d are the long-tail qualifiers. For most businesses, targeting long-tail keywords with local qualifiers is the best strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Identifying Keywords<\/h3>\n<p>There are hundreds of online tools that SEO professionals and business owners can use to conduct keyword research, but the most commonly used is the <a href=\"http:\/\/adwords.google.ca\/KeywordPlanner\" target=\"_blank\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a>. The Keyword Planner is designed for planning and purchasing keyword for pay per click (PPC) campaigns, but the information it provides is hugely beneficial for organic SEO, as well. The \u201caverage monthly search\u201d number is the most important stat when identifying a good keyword, but the \u201ccompetition\u201d and \u201csuggested bid\u201d columns can also help to give you an idea of how easy\/difficult it would be to rank highly for a certain term.<\/p>\n<h3>SEO with A Nerd\u2019s World<\/h3>\n<p>Here at A Nerd\u2019s World, our SEO experts work in tandem with our clients to formulate a keyword plan that is custom tailored to their business.

I\u2019ve worked very hard for everything I\u2019ve been able to do and for everything I have. Right after I graduated from High School I was arrested essentially for being homeless. I was staying in an abandoned hospital and had lit a small fire to keep me warm. Someone walking by spotted smoke coming out of one of the windows and called the police and was arrested for trespassing. My Grandparents helped me get my first apartment, and also used to bring me food every Sunday from their butcher shop. The Government of Ontario gave me a cheque every month to help with rent. At that point I was working on my business relentlessly and could see my future success. Now finally, through all the hard work I\u2019m able to live the life I\u2019ve wanted to. With hard work comes great pleasure, and I\u2019m only getting started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15181\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/signature1.png\" alt=\"chris-signature\" width=\"200\" height=\"48\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Chris A.

As a Toronto web-design company, we\u2019ve noticed that a large number of the websites we\u2019ve worked on were using old, low quality, stock images of the Toronto skyline. These images were getting recycled and were being used by almost everyone. We decided to solve this issue by providing our very own drone video service. We are currently developing a comprehensive catalogue of footage all across Toronto exclusively for our clients. Our service will be available by next month and all of our recordings will be in 4K HD resolution and shot with a DGI Phantom 3 Professional drone. <strong>We will be licensing these original 15-30 second videos for $100 dollars each<\/strong>, and I will be shooting the aerial drone footage personally.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cOnline retailer\u00a0Living Direct found that videos boosted conversion as well as\u00a0increasing time on site by 9%.\u201d &#8211; <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.internetretailer.com\/2010\/10\/07\/living-direct-raises-conversions-video-demos\">Internet Retailer, 2010<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Putting videos on your website will make people view your webpage longer, it will retain their attention, and give them a better overall experience.

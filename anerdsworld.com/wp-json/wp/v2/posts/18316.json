For instant photography enthusiasts such as myself, this was devastating. There is a romanticism in taking a picture, tearing apart the film, and waiting in anticipation for the photo. It pains me to think that pulling away film will soon be a thing of the past. FP-100C was the only pull away film left, and its discontinuation puts the final nail in the coffin for peel apart film.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of peel away film is that you pull apart the negative on the instant film which can allow you to make prints. The FP-100c takes incredible photographs and was still being used up until recently by professional photographers and amateur photographers alike.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<em>It&#8217;s fine grain and rich tonal gradation make it ideal for passport photos, commercial test shots, presentations, ID photos, and direct printing<\/em>,\u201d \u2013 Fujifilm on FP-100C film<br \/> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People may have heard my interview on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/programs\/metromorning\/polaroid-protest-1.3501414\" target=\"_blank\">CBC Radio Metro Morning<\/a><\/span>, or seen me on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jf2sx2HdvUw&amp;nohtml5=False\" target=\"_blank\">Storage Wars Canada<\/a><\/span> evaluating items related to photography. For these reasons, I\u2019ve been titled the film ambassador, a position I\u2019m honored to fill. I believe it is my responsibility to give light to what is happening to countless instant photography fanatics who are left with Type-100 cameras that will be useless without FP-100c instant film.<\/p>\n<p>This morning at 8:47 am I was contacted by a City TV news editor. I did a face-time interview with CTV news anchor Marcia MacMillan live, and an interview in person for CTV Toronto news. The interview I gave titled \u2018The campaign to save instant film\u2019 was about how there is over 20,000 signatures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/save-instant-film\" target=\"_blank\">change.org<\/a> imploring FujiFilm or companies like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/us.impossible-project.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Impossible Project<\/a><\/span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lomography.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lomography<\/a><\/span> to save FP-100c film. As a fellow film enthusiast it is heartening to see that other like-minded individuals are passionate and are taking action to try to save this film, and I encourage anyone reading this to sign the petition at this link.<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x4XCQQRROKE&#038;nohtml5=False<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve even incorporated my love for photography at my company, A Nerd\u2019s World. When we shoot headshots or do photography for commercial clients we do it digitally, but we\u2019ve setup a display of over 300 vintage cameras for our clients to look at when they are at our Bathurst store front or Richmond street location. Digital photography may be more practical but, I believe it is incredibly important to understand the roots of photography for anyone who truly has a passion for it.<\/p>\n<p>It saddens me to think that photography enthusiasts even twenty years from now will never experience the joy I\u2019ve had of peeling away film. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have a supply of some of the film left for myself, but I know that there are others that aren\u2019t so lucky, and my heart goes out to them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15181\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/signature1.png\" alt=\"chris-signature\" width=\"200\" height=\"48\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Chris A.

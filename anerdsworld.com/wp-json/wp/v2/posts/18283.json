For that actor walking by in need of a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.anerdsworld.com\/best-photo-studios-toronto\/\" target=\"_blank\">new headshot<\/a>\u00a0or that small business owner thinking of redesigning their website \u2013 they now have the incentive to get it done, and they have a name of a local\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.anerdsworld.com\/toronto-web-design-companyweb-development\/\" target=\"_blank\">website design company<\/a><\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">in mind without having to do any extra research \u2013 even if they never step foot in the store.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p lang=\"en-CA\">On a recent trip to Chicago, I was inspired to add more bold signage to our window storefront. I contacted Mural Form and Jason Rouleau visited our\u00a0shop and made our design into a reality. This is the second hand painted set of sign that Jason Rouleau has completed\u00a0at A Nerd\u2019s World. We highly recommend Mural Form for their unique style in signage that will draw attention to your business. In 2013, <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.muralform.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Rouleu of Mural Form<\/a><\/strong> painted the tallest mural in the world on 200 Wellesley street east &#8211; measuring in at over 29 stories high.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p lang=\"en-CA\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The new addition on our store windows can be seen from blocks away. There is no question as to what we do with our vibrant signage.\u00a0<\/span>Every design we create is unique \u2013 so it was important that our sign be one-of-a-kind as well.

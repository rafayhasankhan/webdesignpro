But some words and phrases can be unclear, unnecessary, or even offensive. Maybe some of these are words and phrases you like building into your business vocab, but use them with caution. If you\u2019re going to offend or loose a sale, or if there\u2019s a clearer way to say something, why not go the easy way?<\/p>\n<p>Our little caveat: every office has different protocol. If you\u2019re friendly with your clients, it\u2019s not so strange to talk to them about personal issues. And if you\u2019re in the thick of the consulting, tech, or business world, you might feel inclined to use the lingo and play along.

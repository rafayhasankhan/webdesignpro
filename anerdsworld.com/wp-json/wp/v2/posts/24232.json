When it comes to your business &#8212;\u00a0whether you\u2019ve already launched or if you\u2019re still in the whiteboard phase &#8212;\u00a0knowing your \u201cwhy\u201d will help you stay committed to your dream and help others get on board, too.<\/p>\n<p>There are many reasons why people become entrepreneurs: personal satisfaction, creative independence or financial autonomy &#8212; the list goes on. Yet all of these have one thing in common. At the core, they all are about freedom.<\/p>\n<p>That freedom can come in many different forms: the freedom to make changes without waiting for corporate green lights, the freedom to offer a product or service that does business differently\u00a0or maybe the literal freedom to actually make that dentist appointment once and for all.<\/p>\n<p>What is it that drives you? The reason probably isn\u2019t money\u00a0&#8212; at least\u00a0it shouldn\u2019t be. There\u2019s a reason that career counselors across the country ask the same time-old question: &#8220;If money were no object, what would you do?&#8221;too much to bear. This is when your \u201cwhy\u201d becomes imperative.<\/p>\n<div id=\"h0mtwns2cf\" class=\"banner-ad adbox adbox--called\" data-key=\"a2ad\">If you aren&#8217;t 100 percent\u00a0committed to making your vision a reality, you won\u2019t be impassioned enough to nurture your business through its inevitable growing pains. Businesses rarely make money right off the bat, so the dream of money alone will not be reason enough to see it through. Don\u2019t trade in the shackles of your corporate day job for a gilded cubicle of your own making.<\/div>\n<p>If a paycheck is just a means to end, how do you know when you\u2019ve reached it? Is it after five years? 10? Or when you finally make a down payment on a house? The more material possessions you acquire &#8212;\u00a0a car, a house, that timeshare in Vermont &#8212;\u00a0the more that steady, safe paycheck becomes a crutch. So ask yourself, \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once you find an answer that speaks to your soul, the next question should be, \u201cWhat am I waiting for?<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/chrissignature.png\" width=\"195\" height=\"80\" \/><br \/>\nChris A.

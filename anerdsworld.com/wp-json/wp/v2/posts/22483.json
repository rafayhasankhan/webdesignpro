Where to find a good Dropshipper? How much money do you need to get started?<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS DROPSHIPPING?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dropshipping is a type of business model which enables a company to operate without maintaining inventory, owning a warehouse to store their products, or even having to ship their products to their customers themselves. How it works is that the retailer partners up with a dropship supplier that manufactures and\/or warehouses products, package the products and ships them directly to the retailer\u2019s customer, on the retailer\u2019s behalf.<\/p>\n<p>In simpler terms, this is how dropshipping works:<\/p>\n<p>1. The customer places an order for a product on the retailer\u2019s online store.<br \/>\n2. The retailer automatically or manually forwards the order and customer details to the dropship supplier.<br \/>\n3. The dropship supplier packages and ships the order directly to the customer in the retailer\u2019s name.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHERE TO FIND A GOOD DROPSHIPPER?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The simple answer is &#8211; Google is your friend. I used to use www.ioffer.com as a great starting point to search products, and contact sellers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED TO GET STARTED?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To be honest, you don&#8217;t need much. You only need enough to purchase a domain and hosting, plus pay for a Shopify website to get started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHERE CAN I GET MY WEBSITE DESIGNED IN TORONTO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/toronto-web-design-companyweb-develope\"><strong>Web Development and Site Designers<\/strong><\/a> page here.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/chrissignature.png\" width=\"195\" height=\"80\" \/><br \/>\nChris A.

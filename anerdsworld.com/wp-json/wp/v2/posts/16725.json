Some less scrupulous web designers crammed their sites full of popular, but irrelevant, keywords. Of course, that only worked for websites who only wanted to display ads and were not concerned with getting visitors to come back.<\/p>\n<p>Today, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webopedia.com\/TERM\/S\/SEO.html\" target=\"_blank\">SEO<\/a> isn&#8217;t just for con men any more. Respectable businesses are learning how to optimize their websites so they can be found by people who are searching for the products and services they want to sell. This means, of course, that they don&#8217;t just want visitors to drop by once. They hope to keep them coming back. This is why content is so important.<\/p>\n<p>Webmasters and SEO experts have a saying: \u201cContent is King.\u201d It&#8217;s very true. A website&#8217;s content, even more so than its products or service, is what attracts visitors. If you can&#8217;t write good content yourself, Our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anerdsworld.com\/freelance-seo-copywriter-toronto\/\">copywriter<\/a> can help you by providing an author who can write SEO-optimized for your industry.<\/p>\n<p>There are two important aspects of web content\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0Quantity and Quality:<\/p>\n<p>Quality means that the content should be well written and be free from those embarrassing typos that make visitors wonder if your website really knows what it&#8217;s talking about. For our purposes, however, it also means that content should be rich in keywords, informative and interesting, so that the visitor feels they&#8217;ve learned something. Such is the power of Quality content.<\/p>\n<p>Quantity, on the other hand, means that your website should be updated regularly with new content added. A visitor may return to an informational article once, or even two or three times, but if your website&#8217;s content never changes, eventually, there will be no reason for them\u00a0to return.<\/p>\n<p>How often should you add new content to your site? This is where experts differ. Some say once a week is often enough. Others say once\u00a0a day, at least. It depends on the nature of the site, of course; a website&#8217;s commercial blog should be updated once &#8211; or even twice &#8211; per day. Static content, however, can be added once or twice a week. Try to space it out. Going for weeks without adding anything then suddenly adding ten different articles isn&#8217;t going to get you anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Content truly is king on the Internet. Use it properly, and first-time visitors will become repeat visitors. \u00a0Do you need help with your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.anerdsworld.com\/best-toronto-web-design\/\">SEO strategy<\/a><\/span>?

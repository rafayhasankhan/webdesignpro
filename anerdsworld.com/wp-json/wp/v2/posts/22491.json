After 30 days of renovations, our doors opened to the public, and I quickly realized that I bit off more than I could chew.<\/p>\n<p>Our business was growing so fast, that it was hard to take in all at once. I was already clocking 16 hour days in the office, and this 4th location (at the time we had 4 locations) was impossible to manage with the high standards that I set.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to temporarily close this location. I continued to pay rent but the store sat vacant for almost 4 months, while I hired and trained a new team of nerds to work at A Nerd&#8217;s World.<\/p>\n<p>Then last months a water pipe burst and ruined our whole interior and window signage. After 4 weeks of renovation, the store is now complete and better than ever.<\/p>\n<p>So today we celebrated the grand re-opening of our storefront!!! What an exciting time, and I&#8217;m still anxious to get to work every morning. I will be running the newest storefront for the first 2 months, as I&#8217;m basically starting from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Follow me on this journey as an entrepreneur.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/chrissignature.png\" width=\"195\" height=\"80\" \/><br \/>\nChris A.

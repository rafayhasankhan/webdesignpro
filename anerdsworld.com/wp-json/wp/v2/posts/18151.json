The announcement has caused a stir in the film community, with film photographers all over the world protesting the company&#8217;s decision. A rumour has sparked about <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/petapixel.com\/2016\/03\/12\/impossible-founder-meeting-with-fuji-to-keep-peel-apart-film-alive\/\" target=\"_blank\">FujiFilm meeting with Kaps founder of The Impossible Project<\/a><\/strong>, to keep the line in production. Film enthusiasts have begun purchasing the remaining stock before it is extinct. The audio interview can be heard <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/programs\/metromorning\/polaroid-protest-1.3501414\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div>There are over 400 vintage cameras displayed at both A Nerd\u2019s World locations. The camera wall has brought international attention to the business and my hobby. The impressive collection has opened up many opportunities for marketing and features in the press which gained us much success for being unique and a one-of-a-kind shop.\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>Last summer, I was asked to appraise an antique camera on Storage Wars Canada. \u00a0Upon airing on television, the camera wall has become a tourist attraction and has gained new clients appreciating the personal aspect of the business. Every time the show airs, I receive a dozen phone calls by elderly women asking if I would be interested in purchasing the film cameras collecting dust in their attics.

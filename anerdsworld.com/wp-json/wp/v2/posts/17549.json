Once accessible only to military and government personnel, drones were mainly used in situations or over terrain that was considered too risky for manned flight. Drones now offer an eye in the sky and are used in several different industries for surveillance, digital photography or aerial video.<\/p>\n<p>Our Drone of choice is the<strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dji.com\/product\/phantom-3-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DJI Phantom 3 Professional<\/a> <\/strong>equipped with an HD 4k drone camera that allows us to capture a range of digital content from various altitudes. Drone photography in Toronto is relatively new; however, 2016 is the year to get ahead of the competition by introducing AR drone coverage to your business.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to having stunning bird\u2019s eye imagery that will be unique to your business, here are six reasons to hire us for all <b>Toronto Drone Photography Services in 2018:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Architectural Photography and Visualization<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our smooth cinematic high-resolution imagery allows architects, technologists, and CAD designers to depict a new building in conceptual drawings or CAD renderings accurately. With the number of high-rise condos in Toronto, images of rooftops, balconies and terraces can be easily obtained using our AR drone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0Property Development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For property developers with hundreds of acres of land in their portfolio, obtaining imagery of the property would be pricey if they were to hire a photographer specializing in aerial photography, not to mention a pilot and the rental cost of the plane. With a UAV, costs can be cut and obtaining a higher number of digital images within a shorter amount of time significantly brings operating costs down.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Advertising<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Catch the attention of your customers with stunning visuals taken from angles never seen before. Boat excursions on Lake Ontario to vineyards in the Niagara region, any tourist attraction, can benefit from the breathtaking twist on promotional imagery.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.

Pan and slide over terrain from any altitude to get eye-catching shots to wow your audiences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.

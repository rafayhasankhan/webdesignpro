But we should actually be looking at it as an opportunity to portray an image to our potential clients, to share our brand, and to show \u2018the face behind the business\u2019. We forget that when potential customers are looking at our businesses online, they are also looking at who we are and how we conduct business. They want to make sure that we are serious about quality and good customer service. If the photography on our website is done with a point-n-shoot and on-camera flash against a plain wall with a dark shadow around our head, it sends the wrong message. It shows lack of professionalism. And if we don\u2019t appear to care about our own personal image, then why should our potential customers believe that we would use higher standards for the product or service we are offering?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-17105 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio.jpg\" alt=\"toronto-headshot-studio\" width=\"1176\" height=\"1015\" srcset=\"https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio.jpg 1176w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio-400x345.jpg 400w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio-1024x884.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio-169x146.jpg 169w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio-50x43.jpg 50w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio-576x497.jpg 576w, https:\/\/anerdsworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/toronto-headshot-studio-87x75.jpg 87w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What then, are the elements that determine a strong professional headshot versus an amateur snapshot?<\/p>\n<p>The physical side of taking a \u2018proper\u2019 headshot requires the usage of standard professional equipment- camera, lenses, lighting, and photo editing software. But more importantly than that is the intangible aspect \u2013 Experience. Without the knowledge of how to effectively use camera gear, lighting, or to be able to trouble shoot problems should they arise, leaves you back at square one.<\/p>\n<p>And having a trained artistic eye for posing and directing people in order to achieve the individual\u2019s optimal look, is probably on the top of my list. Everyone is different and needs to be photographed a certain way according to their shape, hair color, gender, skin, and profession. Knowing what lighting to use, in what direction, with each face shape, makes all the difference in the world between an okay shot, and an amazing portrait. A good professional photographer will suggest the proper clothing, analyze the model\u2019s face and then pose and light them accordingly. The last thing to consider is that depending on your profession or what the shot will be used for, you might want to add a little personality to your portrait. Showing your audience a little bit of you, will help them make a connection and start a bond before they even meet you.<\/p>\n<p>And lets not forget the importance of our profile headshots on sites like <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/strong> in which we are directly representing our business.

To capitalize on opportunity and captivate real, live, human readers, an optimized, functional, interactive website is a must. Unfortunately, the Internet is swarming with poor website designs that miss both the technical and content mark. Worse yet, clients and developers alike continuously contribute to the current outbreak of design delinquency in equal measure.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to end ugly websites, once and for all. Let\u2019s take a look at how clients and developers perpetrate this trend of low-quality websites and pinpoint new design and development standards in 2018 that will help end this vicious cycle of \u201call-surface-no-substance\u201d sites.<\/p>\n<div id=\"article-0-inread\"><strong>Clients<\/strong><\/div>\n<p>A client\u2019s unrealistic expectations can doom a website to fail before the design process even begins.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many clients have limited knowledge of what a website should look like, and more importantly, what a functional, intentional website can deliver. They underestimate the value of going beyond esthetics with their sites, assuming that build success relies solely on an appealing interface. Clients believe that, as long as their site \u201clooks good,\u201d it will float in cyberspace, effectively extending brand reach while magically attracting millions of interested users and converting them into customers.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, that\u2019s not how website magic works.<\/p>\n<p>To deliver digital results, a website must offer an engaging, dynamic user experience. Yes, graphics are critical to the design process. However, to optimize success, your site must provide more than compelling graphics. Your developer is or, at least should be working hard behind the scenes for you, creating a sophisticated infrastructure of both site and SEO functionality that must be developed and tested before going live. That is where the website magic truly begins.<\/p>\n<p>A client\u2019s budget expectations can also play a major role in launching an inferior website. When it comes to promoting your brand, it\u2019s important to remember that you ultimately get what you pay for. Effective, intuitive website design is complicated. But the return is well worth the investment. So, clients, invest already. And trust your developer\u2019s insight, talent, and experience as you navigate through the process to a final design that doesn\u2019t just look great, but also achieves all of your critical online marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Website Developers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course, clients aren\u2019t the only ones perpetuating bad websites. Developers themselves can also contribute to the slew of poorly-designed, ineffective sites plaguing the Internet. How? It often starts by treating must-have digital marketing features as \u201cextras\u201d when offering site packages to clients.<\/p>\n<p>Not cool, developers. Not cool.<\/p>\n<p>Developers, 2018 is the year you up your game and raise the bar on acceptable industry standards. No more static, one-dimensional tactics that render a site into a mere Powerpoint presentation (aka ugly website). Going forward, refuse to work on a design that isn\u2019t multidimensional and fully-functional. Every project you take on should have all necessary digital marketing functions to elevate both owner and user experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2018 Website Feature Checklist<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ready to put an actionable plan in place to redefine the new normal for 2018 sites?
